## How to play
Just enter you name, select the amount of cards you want to play with and hit the "Start game"-button. Now click on the cards and try to find two of a kind. If you've guessed correctly, these cards will stay revealed, otherwise, they will get turned back over and you will have to try again.

## Features

### Different amounts of cards
At the beginning of the game you can decide, with how many cards you want to play. Currently, you can choose between 16, 24 and 36.

### Star rating
When you turned all cards correctly, you will recieve a rating in stars. You will start the game with 5 stars. After certain time periods and moves, stars will be removed - so make no mistakes and be quick!
**Note**: If you play with more cards, you will get more time and more moves until a star will be removed.

### Keyboard support
Use [Tab] and [Tab]+[Shift] to navigate through the buttons and cards. Use [Space] or [Enter] to interact with buttons or turn cards.
